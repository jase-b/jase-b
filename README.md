<h2>NaviStats</h2>

  - A subscription-based web platform that provides reporting and tracking tools for companies in the real estate title industry. NaviStats is comprised of the two applications: TitleTrak and AgentMap.

    <h3>Challenges & Achievements</h3>

    - <h4>Customized Date Range Picker</h4>

      Builds upon Material UI's [Date Range Picker](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/date-range-picker/#customize-the-field) component. Leverages the feature to easily select commonly used date ranges.

    - The NaviStats marketing website ([navistats.com](https://navistats.com/)) is a WordPress site. The actual NaviStats web application, navistats.com/dashboard, is a React application served from the NaviStats WordPress site using the [ReactPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/reactpress/) plugin.
      This required solutions for some unique issues created by the WordPress-React relationship. For example:

      <h4><b>Special route handling</b></h4>

        - WordPress handles URL routing by matching URL path segments to WordPress Pages. This includes routing users to the NaviStats Dashboard page (/dashboard) which loads the React application.
          But there's a limitation with the Dashboard's ability to handle routing operations using a tool like `react-router`.

          For example, if I wanted to show in the user's URL that AgentMap is currenlty loaded, I ideally would like the URL to read as navistats.com/dashboard/agent-map. However, this will not work as intended. The WordPress router will attempt to load a WP Page that's assigned to the /agent-map route, which doesn't exist. React will never get the chance to load and control the routing to the React-based AgentMap and TitleTrak applications.

          In order to allow some kind of URL customization that represented a user's current application and application state, I decided to leverage the search parameter component of a URL. 

      <h4><b>WordPress Metadata API for simple data storage</b></h4>

      <h4><b>Instrusive UI when logged in as WordPress admin</b></h4>

      <h4><b>No option for server-side rendering</b></h4>

<h2>Carvana</h2>

  - In Carvana's income verification flow, a user is expected to upload proof of income documention. I implemented the UI/UX responsible for capturing those documents. ([Demo](https://github.com/jase-b/carvana-ui-demo#in-carvanas-income-verification-flow-a-user-is-expected-to-upload-proof-of-income-documention-i-implemented-the-uiux-currently-used-to-capture-those-documents-see-the-code) | [Code](https://github.com/jase-b/carvana-ui-demo/tree/main/pay-stub-upload))
  
  - I implemented the newer, simpler design for the driver's license upload experience. ([Demo](https://github.com/jase-b/carvana-ui-demo/tree/main/drivers-license-upload#carvana-ui-demo) | [Code](https://github.com/jase-b/carvana-ui-demo/tree/main/drivers-license-upload))
